# Overview

The Pioneer Valley Tip-Off Data Analytics Team serves to collect and analyze real time basketball data. The work from 2022 is posted here. You will find the following repositories consisting of a code file and a ReadMe section for each of the following down below:

- Data Cleaning
- Visualizations & Insights
- Four Factors Model (Logisitc Regression)

Along with these code files, we have generated scouting reports (not on GitHub) for each of the teams using the data that was scrapped and added from these files. Ideally, future iterations will take the exisiting repositories from here and make changes or add new datapoints.
